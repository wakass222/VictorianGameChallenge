You informed your teacher. By telling a safe adult who you know and trust, you are kept safe from danger. The predator will find it much harder to harm or abduct you while under adult supervision. You should never talk to online strangers in the first place, and most definitely should not organise to meet up offline. Despite staying safe, you did give away details about where you go to school, and confirmed both your identity and your phone number. The best method in putting yourself at the lowest risk possible is to block the stranger immediately. Well Done.
