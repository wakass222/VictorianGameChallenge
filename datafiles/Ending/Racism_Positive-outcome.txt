You tell a teacher about the situation. Being a bystander is just as bad as the bully. It was the right thing to tell someone about it, and stand up to the bully. By not encouraging or tolerating the bullying, you have set a good example for others against unjust racial discrimination. The bully is also less likely to continue without any backing support. Well Done.
