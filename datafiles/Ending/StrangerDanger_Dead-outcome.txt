You go to the main gate and see a lady waving from a blue Mazda. You decide to hop in the car. You are abducted and murdered. You should never talk or meet with strangers met online. While online, people can easily pretend to be someone they're not. You also should not have confirmed personal details about yourself. Also, a lady makes no difference; predators can be of both genders. Never trust online strangers. This stranger lied that your mother couldn't pick you up. The best method in putting yourself at the lowest risk possible is to block the stranger immediately. Don't fall into their trap.
