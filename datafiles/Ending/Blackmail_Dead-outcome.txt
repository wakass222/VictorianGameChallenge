A few days later the blackmailer comes to your house. You should have never taken action by yourself. By complying with the demands or provoking the blackmailer with your own threats, you increased the chance of the blackmailer carrying out their threat. Reporting the blackmailer to the police is the right thing to do as they know how to professionally handle these situations. Never keep it to yourself.
