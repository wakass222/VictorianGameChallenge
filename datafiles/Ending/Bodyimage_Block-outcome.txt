The next day, the bully comes and looks for you and continues to torment you. Simply blocking the bully does not stop the bullying from occurring. Though it may be hard to talk to someone about the bullying, a trusted individual can give you support and help you to respond and overcome bullying. It is important to always have good self-esteem and accept yourself as you are.
