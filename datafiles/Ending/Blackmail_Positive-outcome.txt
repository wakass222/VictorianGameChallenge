The police are informed and manage to capture the blackmailer. Reporting the blackmailer is the right thing to do. Blackmailing is considered a crime and should always be reported to the police who know how to professionally handle these situations. You should never take matters into your own hands as it can lead in the blackmailer carrying out their threat. Well done.
