The blackmailer arrives at your house within minutes, breaks opens the door and murders you. You should have never taken action by yourself. By provoking and angering the blackmailer with your own threats, you increased the chance of the blackmailer carrying out their threat. Reporting the blackmailer to the police is the right thing to do as they know how to professionally handle these situations. Never keep it to yourself.
