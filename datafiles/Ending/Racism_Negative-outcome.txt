You and your friend leave the library. By tolerating bullying, you have succumbed to peer influence and also served as a bystander to unjust racial discrimination. Being a bystander is just as bad as being the bully. Try and develop a strong sense of yourself and your own true values, to make it easier for you to draw the line. Do not tolerate or encourage bullying. A bully is less likely to continue his ways without any backing support.
